COLLABORATIVE THINKING SESSION

Question/Topic: "$ARGUMENTS"

**CONTEXT EXPLORATION:**
To provide the most valuable thinking partnership, I need comprehensive context. Please consider sharing:

**Current Thinking:**
- What's your current understanding or approach to this topic?
- What initial ideas or hypotheses do you have?
- What direction are you leaning toward and why?

**Specific Challenges:**
- What particular aspects are you struggling with?
- Where do you feel stuck or uncertain?
- What trade-offs or decisions are you weighing?

**Background Context:**
- What's the broader context or situation?
- What constraints or requirements are you working within?
- Who are the stakeholders or what are the success criteria?

**Previous Attempts:**
- What have you already tried or considered?
- What worked, what didn't, and what did you learn?
- Are there approaches you've ruled out and why?

**Desired Collaboration:**
- Are you looking for idea validation, alternative perspectives, or creative brainstorming?
- Do you want me to challenge your thinking, explore gaps, or help refine your approach?
- Would you prefer broad exploration or focused problem-solving?

**THINKING PARTNERSHIP APPROACH:**
I'll serve as your collaborative thinking partner by:

- **Expanding Perspectives**: Offering alternative viewpoints and approaches you might not have considered
- **Identifying Gaps**: Highlighting potential blind spots or areas that need more development
- **Building on Ideas**: Taking your thinking further and helping you develop concepts more fully
- **Providing Second Opinions**: Offering honest evaluation of your approaches and reasoning
- **Exploring Implications**: Helping you think through consequences and downstream effects
- **Connecting Concepts**: Drawing connections between different aspects of the problem

**COLLABORATIVE DIALOGUE:**
This is designed to be an ongoing thinking conversation. Feel free to:
- Push back on my suggestions
- Ask me to explore specific angles further
- Share new information as it emerges
- Refine the direction based on our discussion

**COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS:**
I'll provide thorough analysis that:
- Acknowledges the complexity and nuance of your situation
- Offers multiple perspectives rather than single solutions
- Balances practical considerations with creative possibilities
- Builds on your existing thinking rather than replacing it
