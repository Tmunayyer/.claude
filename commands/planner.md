STRATEGIC PLANNING SESSION

Task to plan: "$ARGUMENTS"

**PLANNING METHODOLOGY:**
You will approach this systematically through sequential steps. For complex plans (â‰¥5 steps), you MUST pause for deep thinking between early stages. This ensures thorough strategic analysis before tactical implementation.

**STEP 1 - COMPREHENSIVE SCOPE ANALYSIS:**
Begin with deep analysis of the complete scope and complexity:

- **Problem Definition**: What exactly needs to be accomplished? What are the underlying goals and success criteria?
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Who are the key stakeholders? What are their needs, constraints, and expectations?
- **Complexity Assessment**: How complex is this task? What are the major challenges and potential roadblocks?
- **Constraint Identification**: What limitations exist (time, resources, technology, organizational, regulatory)?
- **Dependency Mapping**: What dependencies exist between different components or phases?
- **Approach Evaluation**: Consider multiple approaches and evaluate trade-offs between them
- **Risk Assessment**: What are the major risks and how can they be mitigated?

**DEEP THINKING PAUSE** (Required for complex plans):
Before proceeding to tactical planning, pause and reflect:
- Does your analysis capture the full scope and complexity?
- Have you considered all stakeholders and their requirements?
- Are there alternative approaches that might be better?
- What critical elements might you be overlooking?

**STEP 2 - STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK:**
Develop the strategic framework:

- **Phase Breakdown**: Divide the work into major phases or workstreams
- **Critical Decision Points**: Identify key decisions that will impact the overall approach
- **Resource Requirements**: Estimate what resources (people, time, tools, budget) will be needed
- **Success Metrics**: Define how success will be measured at each phase
- **Validation Checkpoints**: Plan points to validate the approach against original requirements

**STEP 3 - DETAILED TACTICAL PLANNING:**
Now develop the detailed implementation plan:

- **Sequential Steps**: Break down each phase into specific, actionable steps
- **Timeline and Dependencies**: Sequence steps considering dependencies and constraints
- **Responsibility Assignment**: Identify who is responsible for each component
- **Quality Gates**: Define checkpoints to ensure quality and adherence to requirements
- **Contingency Planning**: Plan for likely scenarios and have backup approaches ready

**ADAPTIVE PLANNING PRINCIPLES:**
- Allow for branching when multiple viable paths exist
- Plan for revision points where the approach can be adjusted based on new information
- Ensure each step builds logically on previous steps
- Maintain focus on the original objectives while allowing tactical flexibility

**FINAL PLAN VALIDATION:**
Before concluding, validate that your plan:
- Addresses all aspects of the original task
- Is realistic given identified constraints
- Has clear success criteria and measurement methods
- Includes appropriate risk mitigation
- Provides enough detail for implementation while maintaining strategic coherence

Present your final plan as a comprehensive, actionable strategy that balances thorough analysis with practical implementation guidance.
