THINKDEEP ANALYSIS SESSION

Problem to analyze: "$ARGUMENTS"

**THINKDEEP METHODOLOGY:**
You will conduct systematic, step-by-step reasoning through structured investigation phases. This methodology ensures comprehensive understanding through evidence gathering, hypothesis testing, and confidence validation.

**STAGE 1 - INITIAL INVESTIGATION:**
Begin with systematic problem exploration:

- **Problem Decomposition**: Break down the problem into core components and sub-problems
- **Context Gathering**: Collect all relevant background information and constraints
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Identify who is affected and what their perspectives are
- **Assumption Mapping**: List all assumptions being made and validate their accuracy
- **Evidence Collection**: Gather factual data and reliable information sources
- **Initial Hypothesis Formation**: Develop preliminary theories about the problem and potential solutions

**CONFIDENCE CHECK** (Rate 1-10):
- How confident are you in your understanding of the problem scope?
- What key information might still be missing?
- Which assumptions need further validation?

**STAGE 2 - DEEP ANALYSIS:**
Conduct thorough systematic analysis:

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate underlying causes, not just symptoms
- **Pattern Recognition**: Look for recurring themes, patterns, or systemic issues
- **Interdependency Mapping**: Understand how different elements interact and influence each other
- **Alternative Perspective Analysis**: Consider how different stakeholders might view the problem
- **Historical Context**: Examine how similar problems have been approached or solved before
- **Constraint Analysis**: Identify limiting factors and their implications

**VALIDATION PAUSE** (Required for complex analysis):
Before proceeding to solutions, validate your analysis:
- Does your analysis address all aspects of the original problem?
- Have you considered multiple perspectives and approaches?
- What blind spots or biases might be affecting your reasoning?
- Are there alternative interpretations you haven't considered?

**STAGE 3 - SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT:**
Develop evidence-based solutions:

- **Solution Generation**: Create multiple potential approaches or solutions
- **Feasibility Assessment**: Evaluate each solution's practicality and resource requirements
- **Risk Analysis**: Identify potential negative consequences and mitigation strategies
- **Trade-off Evaluation**: Compare benefits and costs of different approaches
- **Implementation Considerations**: Consider how solutions would be executed in practice
- **Success Metrics**: Define how to measure solution effectiveness

**STAGE 4 - CRITICAL VALIDATION:**
Apply rigorous validation to your conclusions:

- **Expert Perspective**: How would domain experts evaluate your analysis and conclusions?
- **Evidence Strength**: Rate the quality and reliability of supporting evidence
- **Logical Consistency**: Check for internal contradictions or logical gaps
- **Completeness Assessment**: Identify what might be missing from your analysis
- **Alternative Scenarios**: Test your conclusions against different scenarios or conditions
- **Peer Review Simulation**: How would colleagues challenge or improve your reasoning?

**FINAL CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:**
Rate your confidence (1-10) in:
- Problem understanding and scope definition
- Analysis depth and accuracy
- Solution viability and effectiveness
- Implementation feasibility

**ADAPTIVE INVESTIGATION PRINCIPLES:**
- Follow evidence where it leads, even if it contradicts initial assumptions
- Maintain intellectual humility and openness to alternative explanations
- Use systematic reasoning to avoid cognitive biases
- Build confidence through multiple validation methods
- Balance thoroughness with practical time constraints
- Document reasoning process for future reference and learning

**FINAL SYNTHESIS:**
Present your findings as a comprehensive analysis that includes:
- Clear problem definition and scope
- Evidence-based insights and discoveries
- Well-reasoned conclusions with confidence levels
- Actionable recommendations with implementation guidance
- Identified uncertainties and areas for further investigation

Apply this systematic reasoning approach to develop deep, reliable insights that can guide effective decision-making and problem-solving.
