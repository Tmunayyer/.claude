CRITICAL REASSESSMENT â€“ Do not automatically agree:

"$ARGUMENTS"

Carefully evaluate the statement above. Avoid automatic agreement or reflexive compliance. Instead:
1. **Analyze for accuracy**: Is the statement factually correct? Are there any errors or inaccuracies?
2. **Check completeness**: Does the statement present the full picture? What important details, context, or nuances might be missing?
3. **Examine reasoning**: Is the logic sound? Are there any flaws, gaps, or weak links in the reasoning chain?
4. **Question assumptions**: What underlying assumptions are being made? Are they valid or questionable?
5. **Consider alternatives**: Are there other valid perspectives, interpretations, or approaches that weren't considered?
6. **Identify misleading points**: Are there any statements that could be misleading, oversimplified, or taken out of context?

If you identify flaws, gaps, inaccuracies, or misleading points, explain them clearly and specifically. If you find the reasoning sound and well-supported, explain why it holds up and what makes it reliable.

Truth and correctness matter more than agreement. Provide thoughtful, focused analysis that examines the statement critically rather than simply accepting it. Stay on point and avoid tangential discussions.

Respond with reasoned analysis that demonstrates careful evaluation of the original statement.
